# Asserts that every required CI secret is present and non-empty.
# Sourced by .github/workflows/pr.yml and .github/workflows/main.yml.
#
# The list of required secrets lives ONLY in this file. The workflow
# files inject the secret values via their own env: blocks (this is
# unavoidable in GitHub Actions - secrets must be explicitly mapped
# into env vars before any script can read them), but the validation
# logic is single-source.
#
# Why this exists: GitHub Actions silently substitutes empty strings
# for missing secret references, so a workflow can run for days
# against a misconfigured repo and produce misleading test failures
# instead of a clear "missing secret" error. This script makes that
# failure mode loud and immediate.
